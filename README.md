# BAT-Card-Game
A custom card game that can be played with up to 3 players.
Rules of the game:
This card game is similar to the basketball game "HORSE". Players take turns placing down cards. The goal is to not surpass a count of 99. Each player has 3 lives. An ace adds either 1 or 11 to the existing total count. The player who puts it down decides. Choose '1' for 1 and '11' for 11. A nine of any suit reverses the direction of play without changing the total. A four of any suit is a pass; a player's turn is skipped without changing the total. A Jack of any suit subtracts 10 from the existing total. Any Queen will take the existing total immediately to 99 or if it is already 99, it remains at 99. Kings add 20 points to the existing total. All other cards add their face value to the total. To choose a card, press '1' for the first card, '2' for the second card, and '3' for the third card. If a player is unable to play without making the count go above 99, they receive a 'B' and a new round begins.The second time a player is unable to play without making the count go above 99, they will receive an 'A'.The third time a player is unable to play without making the count go above 99, they will receive a 'T' and will be eliminated from the game. The last player left is the winner. Good luck!
